# Values and Data Types
- Values are the chunks of information that we store 
- Data types represent the type of value that we have stored and what kind of operations it can go through

### typeof
```javascript
typeof x // outputs the data type of the X variable depedning on it value 
```
## JS two kinds of data 
- primitive (string, number , boolean , undefined , null)
- Objects
  
### null vs undefined 
- null is an assigned value that is meant for a variable
- undefined means a variable exists but it assinged gived a value yet
- typeof null is object ?!
