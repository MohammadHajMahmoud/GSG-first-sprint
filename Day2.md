# Values and Data Types
- Values are the chunks of information that we store 
- Data types represent the type of value that we have stored and what kind of operations it can go through

### typeof
```javascript
typeof x // outputs the data type of the X variable depedning on it value 
```
## JS two kinds of data 
- primitive (string, number , boolean , undefined , null)
- Objects
  
### null vs undefined 
- null is an assigned value that is meant for a variable
- undefined means a variable exists but it assinged gived a value yet
- typeof null is object ?!

### IndexOf && include
- used to find the index of an input argument 
```javascript
"ALOHA".indexOf("L") // outputs 1
"ALOHA".includes("A") // outputs true
```
## Exercises with Strings
```javascript
//add your last name in the players listing
document.getElementyById("pl-name").append("haj mahmoud") =
//find whether page title contains javascript
document.title.includes("JavaScript")
//Captlise The Heading Tic tac toe
document.querySelector("header h1").testContent.toUpperCase()
```
# Operators 
Exercise
Use arithmetic operators to compute:
```javascript
//The total number of siblings of your parents
8+7 // output 15
//The average number of hours you slept this week
(3+3+12+5+6+7+4)/7 //output 5.7
//The number of dogs you'd pet in a week if you pet 1 dog per hour while awake
(24-5.7)*7 // output 128.1
```
