# My 20-Day Learning JavaScript Challenge Journey

## Introduction

Hey there! I'm excited to share my 20-Day Learning JavaScript Challenge journey with you. In this challenge, I'll be focusing on enhancing my JavaScript skills and knowledge, taking on various coding challenges, and completing a series of carefully selected courses. My goal is to improve my proficiency in JavaScript and build a strong foundation to become a better developer.

## Overview

- **Duration:** 20 days
- **Objective:** Improve JavaScript proficiency through daily learning and practice

## Courses

I've handpicked a set of courses to guide me through this learning journey:

1. [JavaScript: From First Steps to Professional](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-first-steps/)
2. [JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/)
3. [Deep JavaScript Foundations, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/deep-javascript-v3/)

These courses come highly recommended, and I'm eager to dive into them to gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript.

## Coding Challenges

I'll be regularly taking up coding challenges provided by the GSG team to put my learning into practice. The first challenge is already here: [First Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/convert-celsius-to-fahrenheit).

## Daily Learning Process

To make the most of this challenge, I've devised a structured daily learning process:

1. **Watch Course Content:** Each day, I'll be dedicating 90 minutes to watch the assigned course content from the courses listed above. This will ensure I cover a wide range of topics and concepts.

2. **Coding Challenges:** After the learning sessions, I'll tackle the JavaScript coding challenges provided by the GSG team. Practical application is crucial for a deeper understanding.

3. **Documentation:** I'll summarize my daily learning in a personal log and document my challenge solutions on a separate readme page. This will serve as a reference for my progress and a great way to review concepts later.

4. **Consistency is Key:** I'll commit to a consistent schedule and allocate sufficient time each day to complete the learning activities. Daily practice will help reinforce my learning.

## Guidelines

To make the most of this challenge, I've set some guidelines for myself:

- **Stay Committed:** I will stay committed to the 20-day challenge, no matter how tough it gets.

- **Take Notes:** I'll take detailed notes during the courses and while solving coding challenges. These notes will be a valuable resource for future reference.

- **Embrace Mistakes:** I understand that making mistakes is part of the learning process. I'll embrace them and learn from them.

- **Engage with the Community:** I'll actively participate in the dedicated discussion Telegram channel provided by GSG. Engaging with other learners will help me gain new insights and perspectives.

- **Celebrate Progress:** At the end of each day, I'll take a moment to appreciate my achievements and reflect on my growth.

## Folder Structure

To keep my progress organized, I've set up a folder structure for each day:

## Conclusion

I'm thrilled to embark on this 20-Day Learning JavaScript Challenge. Through dedicated learning, consistent practice, and active engagement with the community, I'm confident that I'll emerge as a better JavaScript developer. Let's get started and make the most out of this incredible learning opportunity! ðŸš€
