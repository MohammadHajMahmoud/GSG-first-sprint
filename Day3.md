# Arrays 
- A data type that is used to store collections of values
- Each value in an array is called an "element."
- Arrays can store different types of elements, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.
## Usefull array methods 

| Method      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| sort()      | sorts the items of the array in an ascending order      |
| join()      | create a string from the elements of an array      |
| concat()    | combine two or more arrays or values into a new array      |
| push()      | adds an element to the end of the array |
| pop()       | removing the last element |
| shift()     | removing first element|
| unshift()   | adding an element to the beginning |

### Mutable vs immutable 
- mutable means it can be edited like arrays
- immutable means it cant be edited like primitive tytpes
- concat doesnt mutate the array it only make a copy while push and other methods do mutate the array
